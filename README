================================================================

overo_pdgpio allows the state of GPIO pins on the overo 40 pin breakout connector to be used for input and output from within PD (or PDa)

Information on these GPIOs is available here: 

http://gumstix.org/hardware-design/overo-coms/74-overo-connectors/97-gumstix-overo-series-40-pin-header.html

According to this info there should be 3 outputs available to a standard overo:

GPIO144 (pin 30)
GPIO145 (pin 29)
GPIO170 (pin 19)

and 3 inputs:

GPIO114 (pin 4)
GPIO146 (pin27)
GPIO147 (pin 29)

However I wasn't able to get GPIO146 to work under Ubuntu 12.04

=================================================================
WARNING! DO NOT USE THIS SOFTWARE WITH ANY COMPUTER OTHER THAN A GUMSTIX OVERO
HARDWARE DAMAGE IS POSSIBLE BY MANIPULATION OF GPIO PORTS ON EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

To use- 

1. copy *.pd_linux and *.pd to:
        EITHER the same folder as your patch, or the PD extras folder (/usr/lib/pd/extra)

2. create an overo_gpioin or overo_gpiout object and look at the help file

3. see the schematic (eagle cad files) in the overo_controlboard folder for wiring details
